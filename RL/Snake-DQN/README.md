# Solving Snake with DQN

Solving classic games with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has gathered a lot of research attention. This paper proposes a Deep Q-Learning approach to solving the game of Snake up to normal human level. The focal point of this paper is to study the impact of human engineered state space towards the performance of the agent as compared to end-toend pixel approach and the paper have found that human engineered state space could lead to a faster convergence, albeit with a sub-optimal policy ascribable to the inherent bias of the engineered features.
