# Vehicles Detection with Faster-RCNN on MobileNetV3
### End-to-end Object Detection

Author : Wong Zhao Wu

## Abstract
Vehicle detection is one of the core technologies behind the possibility of autonomous vehicles. Finding the perfect trade-off between accuracy and performance has been a challenge in solving the task of object detection for real-time inference. In this study, my goal is to build an end-to-end light weight object detection algorithm using [Faster-RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) coupled with [MobileNetV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02244) with [Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144). The final model has obtained mAP of 0.835 on the hold-out validation set.

## Personal Reflection
For this part C of the assignment, I have spent many effort and countless hours attempting to understand the intuition and implementation details of object detection with Faster-RCNN. Finally, I really appreciate this opportunity for me to venture beyond the syllabus and I am looking forward to continue reading and expand my horizon on ways to further improvethe network or even using different SOTA architecture for better performance.
